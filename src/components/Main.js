         <p> Paperback Pals is a program, 
          created by 11 year old Lane, that gives books to
           the children of migrant workers to say thank you for the hard work 
           that they do in and for our communities. The program is kid lead and kid run. 
        </p>
          <p>Children in Ontario register to buy and donate a new book to the child of a migrant worker.
        This shows our thanks to the migrant workers and gives children 
          and teens a great way to connect with those in another country and perhaps build a penpal friendship.</p>
          <p>We need your help so that we can get books to as many children 
          of migrant workers as possible.  If you are between the ages of 4 and 
        16 please sign up to be a Paperback Pal and make a difference in the life of another child.</p>
          </p>

          Yes. We will do our best to accomodate your preferences.

          <p>
            <h4>Do I need to purchase a book in Spanish?</h4>
            When you are matched with a child I will tell you what language to get the book in.
            Some will need books in Spanish and some will need books in English.
          </p>
          <p>
          <h4>Can I buy a hard cover book?</h4>
          Migrant workers can only return home at the end of harvest season with one suitcase weighing 
          no more than 35 pounds. So we ask that you get a paperback book to reduce weight as much as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
          <h4>Can I get my match more than one book?</h4>
          Because the workers can only have 35 pounds in their suitcases we ask that you only get
           your match one book.
          For this reason we also ask that you do not include extra items like stickers or 
          pencil crayons with your book.
          </p>
          <p>
          <h4>Can I get my match a magazine instead of a book?</h4>
          Paperback Pals was created in part to share the joy of reading.
           Please buy your Paperback Pal an age appropiate fiction book.
             Please no magazines, non fiction books,textbooks or activity books.

          Approximately 30,000 migrant workers come to Ontario from Mexico, Jamaica and the caribbean each year.   
          They leave their home countries for up to eight months  a year to work on Ontario farms.  
          They work hard to make sure that we have fresh fruits and vegetables!  
          As kids we can all say thank you to these migrant workers who work so hard for us by connecting with their children 
          through the donation of  book and the start of pen pal friendship.
